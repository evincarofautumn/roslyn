 <summary>
 This is a design change from Dev10. Showing what we already know is kinda useless.
 This is what C# does. We are modifying VB to follow this model.

<member name="T:Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.UnitTests.Rename.RenameEngineResult">
 <summary>
 A class that holds the result of a rename engine call, and asserts
 various things about it. This is used in the tests for the rename engine
 to make asserting that certain spans were converted to what they should be.

 <summary>
 The list of related locations that haven't been asserted about yet. Items are
 removed from here when they are asserted on, so the set should be empty once we're
 done.

<member name="T:Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Editor.UnitTests.Rename.RenameEngineTests">
 <summary>
 This test class contains tests which verifies that the rename engine performs correct
 refactorings that do not break user code. These tests call through the
 Renamer.RenameSymbol entrypoint, and thus do not test any behavior with interactive
 rename. The position given with the $$ mark in the tests is just the symbol that is renamed;
 there is no fancy logic applied to it.

 <summary>
 Tests for Error List. Since it is language agnostic there are no C# or VB Specific tests
